### Digital-Clock

Apurv Keer and Mridul Goel

This was our project for a course in Digital Systems. This code is used to program a FPGA(Field Programmable Gate Array) in Quartus II 13.1 software. We made a digital clock using the FPGA.

Above are the code files that we used. Content of these files are explained in the pdf report.
